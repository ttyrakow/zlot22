Examples can be built in the Vusual C++ command prompt
configured to emit 32-bit code.

The build.bat script in each subdirectory should be able
to build example code.

If you wish to switch to 64-bit code (the examples should
work just fine in 64 bits), change the invocation of dcc32
to dcc64 in each build.bat file.
