Activate Visual Studio command prompt for building
native x86 (32-bit) applications.
To build 64-bit suite change dcc32 to dcc64 in build.bat
(by default build.bat invokes dcc32, which results in 32-bit code)
and use 64-bit VS command prompt.
Use build.bat to build DLL and executables,
clean.bat will remove all generated files.
This is a console app!
